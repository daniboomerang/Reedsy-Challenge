	This site uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
	<ul class="list-unstyled list-text">
    	<li>Node.js + Express to serve the SPA Angular app. The API REST services are mocked in the front end, so to be practical, for the back end I have chosen the server that I know best</li>
		<li>AngularJS: HTML enhanced for web apps!</li>
	</ul>
